Clutching a grip on AUTOSAR using Haskell
-----------------------------------------

The AUTOSAR standard is an open software component architecture for the automotive industry. Its main goal is to enable interoperability of software modules among different vendors and on heterogeneous platforms, via an extensive set of standardized interfaces and a common software development methodology. As a software architecture, AUTOSAR provides run-time support for concurrent execution, communication, seamless distribution, and selected real-time programming facilities.

However, the sheer size of the AUTOSAR specification (~ 12,500 pages of pdf text and diagrams in version 4.1) obviously makes interpreting the detailed meaning of many AUTOSAR concepts a challenging task. In practice, the AUTOSAR standard is thus naturally approximated as the specific behavior of one's chosen platform and development tools. This phenomenon is not unique to AUTOSAR, and would perhaps not motivate further attention if it weren't for the following aspects of AUTOSAR software development:

1. The scope of the AUTOSAR standard puts platform- and tool neutrality at the core of its features. Yet the AUTOSAR specification aims to cover complex technical areas that traditionally have only been associated with vendor-specific operating systems, real-time kernels, distribution frameworks, etc.

2. The size of typical automotive software systems makes distributed development and testing an absolute necessity. Yet, due to the inherent platform and tool dependencies, faithful testing of an arbitrary AUTOSAR subsystem can only be performed with the full software installation in place.

From this perspective, the platform- and tool-neutral system semantics specified by the AUTOSAR standard is, or should be, the focus of attention. Unfortunately, no authoritative formulation more accessible than a 12,500 page textual specification appears to exist. Not only does this make AUTOSAR development unnecessarily hard and error-prone, it also hampers the emergence of platform-independent tools like simulators, that could enable truly distributed development of interoperable AUTOSAR subsystems.

The RAW FP project at Chalmers University of Technology seeks to demonstrate how the technology of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) embedded in Haskell can be applied to serious industrial software development problems. As one of its main validator tracks, RAW FP has attempted to first formalize the core semantics of AUTOSAR, then implement this semantics as a Haskell DSL that is executable on any major platform under simulated real time. While the formalized semantics captures every possible direction an AUTOSAR system can evolve in at run-time, the embedded DSL defers its scheduling decisions to a pluggable procedure that can select among all legal execution paths. This feature has been put to good use in the implementation of an AUTOSAR simulator with random scheduling, that has the ability to reveal race conditions and other concurrency problems much faster than the partially deterministic scheduler found on typical AUTOSAR platforms. It has also been integrated with the Chalmers QuickCheck tool, to systematically test randomized executions against given properties and minimize any counter-example found.

In this talk I would like to give an overview of the AUTOSAR semantic formalization we have carried out in the RAW FP project, and also show how it has been concretized as a Haskell DSL. In the first part my intent is to illustrate the level of precision at which one can (and should!) study the behavior of complex concurrent real-time systems. Some ambiguities and dubious features of the AUTOSAR specification will also be emphasized, together with suggested paths forward.

In the second part I plan to introduce the small Haskell-based AUTOSAR DSL we have developed at Chalmers, and show how it can be readily used to construct a non-trivial automotive system in the form of an ABS implementation. A comparison with real AUTOSAR code and a discussion on syntactic complexity will be inevitable here, as well as examples of the kind of AUTOSAR validation checks that can be captured using the Haskell type system alone. Simulation runs under different scheduling policies will also be shown, and I'll demonstrate how the addition of QuickCheck may help narrow down a race-condition that real-world testing is likely not to have found.

The talk will conclude on the topic of platform independence versus real-time authenticity, and the role functional programming may play in bridging these seemingly opposite goals. The embedded DSL approach will be in focus, of course, but also some open problems that stand in the way of a more direct adoption of functional programming in the resource-constrained industrial domain.


-------------------------------
Take away bullets
* A platform-independent standard like AUTOSAR must be accompanied by a definition that also allows platform-independent testing and simulation.

* Simulation of a concurrent system under controlled random scheduling is a fantastic tool for finding race-condition bugs.

* A Domain-Specific Language embedded in Haskell can leverage on the benefits of functional programming, and still be highly relevant to the construction of resource-constrained and distributed automotive systems.

* Although highly obscured, the AUTOSAR specification already contains the concept of the Haskell IO monad!

Johan Nordlander holds a Ph.D. from Chalmers University of Technology in 1999, and is currently dividing his time between a research position at Chalmers and his work as a network management consultant for Data Ductus AB. His research interests lie in the fields of formal semantics, real-time constraints, programming language design, and type systems. Nordlander has been deeply involved in the TIMMO and TIMMO-2-USE projects, that provided the foundation for the Timing Extension of the AUTOSAR standard. As a software professional, he is mostly engaged in developing tools and techniques that support software-defined networking.
